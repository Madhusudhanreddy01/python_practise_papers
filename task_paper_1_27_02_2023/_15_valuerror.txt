15. Give the scenarios, when you will get ‘ValueError’
In Python, the ValueError is a built-in exception that is raised when an operation or 
function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value. 
Here are some scenarios in which you may encounter a ValueError in Python:

Incorrect Argument Type: If you pass an argument of the wrong type to a function or method, 
it can raise a ValueError. 
For example, calling int('hello') will raise a ValueError since 'hello' cannot be converted to an integer.

Out of Range: If you provide a value that is outside the valid range for a given operation or 
function, a ValueError may be raised. 
For example, calling int('100000000000000000000000000000000') will raise a ValueError since 
the number is too large to be represented as an integer.

Empty Sequences: If you try to access an element from an empty sequence, such as an empty list 
or tuple, a ValueError may be raised. 
For example, calling lst.pop() on an empty list will raise a ValueError.

Incorrect Format String: If you use an incorrect format string with the str.format() method, 
a ValueError may be raised. 
For example, calling '{}{}'.format(1, 2, 3) will raise a ValueError since there are 
only two placeholders in the format string but three arguments are provided.
Sure, here are some specific examples of scenarios in which a ValueError exception might be raised:

Converting a string that does not represent a valid integer to an integer using the int() function. 
For example:
python
>>> int('abc')
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'

Trying to convert a string that represents a number outside the valid range for the target type to that type. 
For example:
python
>>> float('inf')
inf
>>> int('12345678901234567890')
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12345678901234567890'

Using the range() function with invalid arguments. 
For example:
python
>>> range(5, 1, -1)
[5, 4, 3, 2]
>>> range(1, 5, 0)
ValueError: range() arg 3 must not be zero
