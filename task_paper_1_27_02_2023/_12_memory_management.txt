12. How is memory management done in python? 
If I want to execute a program, the program will allocate some region(memory) in the RAM, 
the region is divided into two parts.
1.Stack
2.Private Heap
Python is an object oriented language, everything is treated as an object.
Test.py                                                        stack               private Heap
a=10                                                             a                       1000
print(type(a))                                                  1000                      10

Output:
10
<class ‘int’>

Everything in python is an object, objects are created on the Heap. Every object will have  
an address and the address is always stored in a reference and reference is created on the stack.
