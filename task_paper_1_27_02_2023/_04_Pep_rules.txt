4. What is the importance of PEP rules
PEP (Python Enhancement Proposal) rules are a set of guidelines for writing Python code that 
are designed to enhance code readability, consistency, and maintainability. 

The importance of following PEP rules includes:
Readability: PEP rules aim to make the code more readable, both for the developer who originally wrote it 
and for others who may need to read and work on it later. 
This can help prevent errors and make it easier to understand what the code does.

Consistency: Consistent code is easier to maintain over time because it's easier to 
understand and modify. PEP rules help ensure that code is written consistently across 
different projects and by different developers, making it easier to maintain.

Collaboration: Following PEP rules can help ensure that different developers can 
collaborate effectively on a project, even if they have different coding styles or backgrounds. 
This can help prevent misunderstandings and make it easier to merge code changes.

Best practices: PEP rules are designed to promote best practices in Python programming. 
By following these guidelines, developers can ensure that their code is optimized for performance, 
security, and other important factors.

Community standards: Following PEP rules is important because they are widely accepted as the 
standard for Python development. By following these guidelines, developers can ensure that their 
code is compatible with other Python projects and libraries.
